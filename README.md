# About

The app is a fitness tracker that gamifies exercise by incorporating theme-based UI catering to nostalgic sentiments of users. Users can choose from a range of themes like Harry Potter or the Roman Empire, and enjoy rewards and points for exercising with friends. It also includes a multiplayer and leaderboard function and a marketplace for merchandise. Users can embark on adventures while exercising, like being Captain Jack Sparrow or Iron Man. Here are some of the key features:

- Fitness
- Adventure
- Nostalgia
- Rewards

Machine Learning

We have implemented sophisticated machine learning algorithms to incorporate smart recovry and recommender systems in our application. The [smart recovery](/WalkTopia_smart_Recovery_algorithm) and implementation of [recommender system algorithm](/WalkTopia_Theme_Recommender/) on our theme recommender has been done. The data set for the theme recommender can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Bbj2RJ8y9BLx4N3E9gthJ-nxFV9wlKRo?usp=share_link). Both the algorithms are a variation of a Recommender system.
